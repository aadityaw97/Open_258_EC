## Instruction
a) CNN basics : use KERAS and from scratch (not using existing architecture shipped models) write basic LeNet (mnist) and VGG-16 model (cifar100)  and RESNET (only 8 layers - not 52) architectures - run on gpu - train and report all the stats (see some pointers in slides)

b) CNN basics : use pytorch and from scratch (not using existing architecture shipped models)  write basic LeNet (mnist) and VGG-16 model (cifar100) and and RESNET (only 8 layers - not 52)  architectures - run on gpu  (use .cuda instruction) - train and report all the stats

c) transfer learning with CNN (either keras or fastai or pytorch - use your favorite)  : Kaggle competion : https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview (Links to an external site.)

 create a dog breeds classifier with > 83% validation accuracy (use all techniques - data =augmentation and transfer learning etc.,.)
