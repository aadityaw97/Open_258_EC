## Instruction (Pointwise)

I) Do write autodiff python  library (we discussed in class)  and based on it , do  mnist classifier in colab (similar to last exercise but using autodiff library  that you will write instead of direct numpy) - DO NOT COPY PASTE FROM BOOK. WRITE CLEAN CUSTOM CODE WITH YOUR OWN CLASS NAMES AND VARIABLE NAMES FROM SCRATCH. 

II) do keras models for four problems (4 different data sets)

a) boolean cross entropy

b) sparse categorical crossentropy (softmax) - try to get images of 7 classes with images.google.com google search and classify 

c) logistic regression

d) multi head classification (multi class classification)
